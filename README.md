# RegularPolygon
This is just one function I made for a lab from my graphics 1 class first semester sophomore year. However, I am really proud of it. We were supposed to make a few different polygons using OpenGL, but I decided to make 1 function that would create any regular polygon given the position, radius, number of sides, and rotation.
